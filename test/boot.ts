    // EFFECTIVE TRACK WIDTH, measured by calt (Calibrate T) from a
    // sensor-defined 180: five well-settled pairs read 176.53, 174.47, 176.05,
    // 173.08 and 173.68 deg of odometry for a true 180 -- mean 174.76, sd 1.49,
    // standard error 0.67 deg. So b = 12.0 * 174.76/180 = 11.647 cm, a 2.9%
    // correction from the compiled 11.996 and about 8 sigma.
    //
    // Corroborated independently by the overhead camera on this robot's own
    // turns: a commanded -30 read -33.15 deg of odometry against -35.0 by
    // camera, and a -76 read -76.72 against -78.7. Those ratios (0.947, 0.975)

    // minimum) and its two halves split 4.63 deg. Settle quality is the
    // discriminator here exactly as it was on gopiv -- and it matters MORE on
    // tigez, because the pivot's sensitivity to a lateral offset is
    // arcsin(d/r) and this robot's r is 9 cm against gopiv's 17. The same
    // half-centimetre of offset is twice the error.

    // mean 11.777, sd 0.040 (0.34%). So slip = 11.44/11.777 = 0.971.

    // BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THIS SETTLES: it does not confirm either earlier
    // number, it splits them. calt (above) said 11.647; radio-robot-lib's
    // tigez.json, from camera-truthed pivots on 2026-09-03, implies 11.896.
    // Those two disagree by 2.1%, and calc lands almost exactly halfway.
    // Preferred anyway, because calc's estimator is the only one of the three
    // that needs neither a fixed centre of rotation nor the lever arm: a RADIAL
    // sector boundary puts a sensor's own consecutive crossings 45 deg apart
    // whatever its radius or offset, and eight sectors sum to 360 so a centring
    // error cancels over a whole revolution. That independence matters most on
    // THIS robot, whose sensor bar is mounted ~7 deg skew (see above) and whose
    // short 9 cm lever doubles calt's arcsin(d/r) sensitivity relative to gopiv.
    //
    // Scatter was the fleet's tightest per-channel: sd 1.7-3.7 deg against
    // gopiv's 7.0-7.6 on the SAME cross, and tigez walked only ~0.25 cm per
    // revolution against gopiv's ~0.5 and tovez's ~1.3. That ordering held on
